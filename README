When it's completed, all of the plots can be generated by running make. Still a work in progress.
Plots coming from outside sources are in the external_plots folder.
Finally, there are some tikz figures in the LaTeX document that are not generated here.

Depends on the usual tools:
spice_tools, hvar, grid_profiles, etc.
